    <p class="wrapText">The Stone Poney is a performing arts center, reserved usually
        for events like concerts, musicals, and pretty much any performances that reserve
        the area. Although this place is available for a variety of artistic people, as an
        audience member, you will most likely be viewing concert performances and music shows,
        as that is what The Stone Poney is known for. Come to The Stone Poney with friends for the
        best experience as you all can come together to listen to some great music.

    <h2>Boxwood Hall State Historic Site</h2>
    <img src="boxwood.jpg" style="float: left;height: 200px;padding-right: 20px;">
    <p class="wrapText">If you are a fan of history, this place is the place for you.
        Boxwood Hall State Historic Site is a historic home originally belonging to Elias
        Boudinot in 1750, who was the President of the Continental Congress that ratified the
        Treaty of Paris. The site is eye-opening, displaying how people used to live, and how
        everyday life back then is completely different than everyday life now. Its almost like
        visiting an Open House from the 1750s. Come here with an open mind to really take a look
        into the past, and get a glimpse of how life used to be back then.
